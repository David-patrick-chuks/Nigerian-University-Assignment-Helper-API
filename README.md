# Nigerian University Assignment Helper API

This API helps Nigerian university students generate AI-powered assignment content and formatted documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) using the Gemini API.

## Features
- AI-powered assignment generation
- Academic formatting (student info, question, content)
- Multiple file formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT
- Rate limiting and input validation
- Supports long assignments by splitting into sections and tracking progress
- **Smart Section Splitting**: Automatically divides long assignments into logical sections (400-600 words each) with descriptive titles
- **Word Count Optimization**: Automatically expands content if word count is below 90% of target (up to 3 expansion rounds)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for long assignments
- **Page Numbering**: Automatic page numbers in PDF and DOCX formats for professional presentation
- Test script with word count comparison and expansion tracking

## Endpoints

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health`

### API Info
- `GET /api/info`

### Generate Assignment (Unified, with Job Status)
- `POST /api/assignments/generate`
- **Description:** Generate an assignment file (doc, docx, pdf, txt). For large assignments (more than 3 pages or 1500 words), the API will process the request as a background job and return a `jobId` immediately. For small assignments, the file is returned directly.
- **Request Body Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "NWAFOR SALOME KACHI",
  "matric": "22/15CA175",
  "department": "HISTORY AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES",
  "courseCode": "HIS301",
  "courseTitle": "INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEM",
  "lecturerInCharge": "PROFESSOR ADEBAYO",
  "fileType": "pdf",
  "numberOfPages": 10,
  "question": "What major political or cultural kingdoms existed in East and Central Africa around 1800 AD, and what roles did they play in regional affairs?"
}
```
- **Response:**
  - For small assignments: returns the file directly.
  - For large assignments: returns `{ success: true, jobId }` and processes the job in the background.

### Check Job Status / Download Result
- `GET /api/jobs/:jobId`
- **Description:** Poll this endpoint to check the status (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`) and progress (percentage) of a long-running assignment job. When `completed`, the result includes the file (as base64), file name, and MIME type.
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": 100,
  "result": {
    "fileName": "assignment_22_15CA175.pdf",
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "buffer": "...base64...",
    "finalWordCount": 4850,
    "targetWordCount": 5000,
    "expansionsUsed": 2
  }
}
```

**Result Fields:**
- `fileName`: Generated file name
- `mimeType`: File MIME type
- `buffer`: File content as base64 string
- `finalWordCount`: Actual word count of the generated assignment
- `targetWordCount`: Target word count based on requested pages
- `expansionsUsed`: Number of expansion rounds used to reach target word count

## Word Count Logic
- The API estimates word count and number of pages for each assignment.
- For long assignments (>3 pages or >1500 words), the system uses smart section splitting:
  - **Section Splitting**: Divides content into logical sections of 400-600 words each
  - **Descriptive Titles**: Uses meaningful section titles (e.g., "Background and Context", "Main Analysis", "Critical Evaluation")
  - **Automatic Expansion**: If the final word count is below 90% of target, the system automatically generates additional content (up to 3 expansion rounds)
- The test script compares the expected word count (numberOfPages √ó 500) with the actual word count returned by the API, and shows expansion information.

## Test Script
- Run `node test-api.js` to test the API endpoints.
- The script saves all responses and files to the `test-output/` folder.
- It now prints both the expected and actual word count for assignment generation.
- For large assignments, the script will poll for job status and download the result when ready.
- **New**: Includes a test for a 10-page assignment to demonstrate section splitting and expansion features.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up your `.env` file with your Gemini API key, MongoDB URI, and other config.
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Run the test script:
   ```sh
   node test-api.js
   ```

## Notes
- The Gemini API has a maximum output length per call. For very long assignments, the backend splits the work into sections and combines the results.
- Formatting is best-effort and can be customized in the codebase.
